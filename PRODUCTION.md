Phase 2: Tutorial Effectiveness (Week 8)
- 10-15 players, 60-minute sessions
- Focus: Onboarding experience and move learning
- Metrics: Tutorial completion rates, help requests
- Iteration: Refine tutorial pacing and explanations

Phase 3: Full Experience Testing (Week 16)
- 15-20 players, 2-3 hour sessions
- Focus: Complete game experience and difficulty curve
- Metrics: Completion rates, frustration points, enjoyment
- Iteration: Final balancing and polish adjustments
```

### Accessibility Testing
```
Visual Accessibility:
- Colorblind simulation testing
- High contrast mode validation
- UI scaling verification
- Motion sensitivity testing

Audio Accessibility:
- Subtitle accuracy and timing
- Audio cue effectiveness without visuals
- Volume balance and clarity testing
- Audio description quality (if implemented)

Cognitive Accessibility:
- Clear instruction comprehension
- Objective clarity and progress indication
- Pause functionality and save system usability
- Simplified control option effectiveness
```

## Quality Assurance

### Performance Benchmarks
```
Target Hardware: Mid-range gaming PC (GTX 1060 equivalent)
- 60fps minimum during normal gameplay
- 45fps minimum during complex scenes (multiple enemies)
- <2 second room loading times
- <16ms input latency
- <512MB memory usage

Compatibility Testing:
- Windows 10/11 (primary platform)
- Multiple controller types (Xbox, PlayStation, generic)
- Various screen resolutions and aspect ratios
- Different audio hardware configurations
```

### Bug Tracking and Priorities
```
Priority 1 (Blocking):
- Input system failures
- Save/load corruption
- Game crashes or freezes
- Progression blocking bugs

Priority 2 (High):
- Performance issues below targets
- Accessibility feature failures
- Audio/visual glitches
- Tutorial or onboarding problems

Priority 3 (Medium):
- Minor visual inconsistencies
- Non-critical audio issues
- Quality of life improvements
- Polish and refinement items
```

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
```
Input System Complexity:
- Risk: Players struggle with dual-circle system
- Mitigation: Extensive playtesting and iteration
- Fallback: Simplified control scheme option

Performance Concerns:
- Risk: Frame rate drops during complex scenes
- Mitigation: Early performance testing and optimization
- Fallback: Scalable graphics settings

Controller Compatibility:
- Risk: Issues with specific controller types
- Mitigation: Test with multiple controller brands
- Fallback: Controller-specific configuration profiles
```

### Design Risks
```
Learning Curve Too Steep:
- Risk: Players abandon game due to difficulty
- Mitigation: Comprehensive tutorial and practice mode
- Fallback: Difficulty options and hint systems

Niche Appeal Limits Audience:
- Risk: Very small player base
- Mitigation: Clear marketing of experimental nature
- Acceptance: Embrace niche positioning as feature

Move System Too Complex:
- Risk: Too many moves overwhelm players
- Mitigation: Limit to 6-8 core moves maximum
- Fallback: Progressive unlock system with optional moves
```

## Success Metrics

### Development Success
```
